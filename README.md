Social media platform for sharing Quran Recitations 

## Minimum Viable Product

* Users create account and authenticate
* Users can upload Quran Recitation, with SOME mandatory information (Reciter name, Masjid name/location, Surah name)
* Content Moderation occurs, rejecting innappropriate and anything that is not Quran (AI detected)
* Users can search reciters by name, location, surah

## NECESSARY features (bare minimum)
* Account creation
* Uploading audio and SOME info (whether name, location, surah - at least one field must be entered in)
* AI Audio content moderation - verify that all audio is Quran
  * AI Text content moderation - no profanity / trolling
* AI Audio Quran verification - verifying accuracy in the recitation of Quran, keep watch for mistakes in recitation (Tarteel)
  * If there is a mistake detected in an audio clip that a person has uploaded, put "Fact Check!" on their post
  * If too many mistakes are detected, prevent the audio clip from being uploaded entirely

## Nice to have features (ideally have these too)
* Favorite posts, saving them to a Favorites section
* Search bar - search by reciter, location, surah etc.
* Likes on a post

## General notes
* App content is all simply a page you scroll of posts consisting of an audio clip with text describing it - that's it
